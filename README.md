# AuthenticationForClient
A auth system for client side in unity, where we input a string code from client to get authentication from server, it's use a unity network, and you can set your own game authentication easily. You just need to create a server (or maybe already have one) and the token from server. 

it's my first open source project in github since long time, feel free if you find an issue and want to improve it or need to contact me
